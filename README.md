# Pygame Tower Defense
Welcome to the Pygame Tower Defense, a captivating tower defense game built using the pygame library in Python. Defend your territory against waves of enemies using strategic placements of turrets, each with unique upgrades to thwart the incoming threats.

Game Features
Diverse Enemies:

Encounter four distinct types of enemies, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
Versatile Towers:

Deploy two types of towers, each with four different upgrades, allowing you to adapt your strategy as the waves of enemies become more challenging.
Object-Oriented Design:

The game is developed using an object-oriented approach, with different classes representing key game elements such as enemies, turrets, and the world. This design ensures modularity and clarity in the code structure.
Centralized Game Control:

The World class takes charge of managing intricate aspects of the game, including enemy waves, available funds, and turret upgrades. This centralization streamlines game control and facilitates easy modifications.
Sprite Groups for Efficiency:

Sprite groups are employed to store and render game entities collectively. This not only enhances processing speed but also minimizes memory usage, contributing to a smoother gaming experience.
Turret Targeting Mechanism:

Turrets intelligently target enemies within a specified range, a range that can be modified through upgrades. Multiple turrets can focus on the same enemy, providing strategic depth to your defenses.

# Development Insights
Object-Oriented Architecture:

Leverage the power of object-oriented programming with classes defining entities such as Enemy, Turret, and World. This design promotes code maintainability and extensibility.
Sprite Groups for Efficiency:

Optimize resource usage by storing and rendering groups of sprites simultaneously. This approach enhances performance and reduces memory overhead.
Turret Targeting Logic:

Implement a sophisticated targeting mechanism for turrets. Upgradable range parameters and the ability for multiple turrets to target the same enemy add layers of strategic depth to the gameplay.
Feel free to explore the codebase, tweak configurations, and contribute to the project. Let the defense begin!
